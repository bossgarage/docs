### Ignition

On the board Jumper JP1, select the voltage sent to the coils:

- Honda distributor coil: 12V
- VAG / K20 coils: 5V

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image44.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image14.png)

**Spark Output Mode:**

- Single channel: Distributor
- Sequential: Coil-on-plug

If you want to convert to a coil-on-plug system, you need to change the distributor disc to: **[Distributor Disc for Honda DPFI](https://bossgarage.eu/en/products/distributor-disc-honda-dpfi)**.

And configure the trigger wheel pattern to be the same as your disc pattern.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image37.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image34.png)

And connect each coil signal to the respective pin declared in the ECU pinout topic.

### Injection

**WARNING:** Use only high impedance injectors (> 8 ohm) or low impedance with resistor box.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image40.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image46.png)

Change the engine displacement and injector flow rate.

## Connecting and Calibrating the ECU

### Calibrate TPS

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image52.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image60.png)

Click on the closed throttle "Get current" button.

Then press full throttle and click on the full throttle "Get current" button.

Now, click "Accept" to save.

### Calibrate MAP

STOCK = Sensor in the engine bay

MPX = Map sensor on the board

Stock map sensor configurations:

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image24.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image32.png)

### Electric Fan

You can control the electric fan by connecting the **OBD1 A8** terminal from the ECU to the negative terminal of the fan relay coil.

### Base Timing

To sync the ignition timing with the engine, it's necessary to adjust with the help of a [Timing Light Gun for Ignition Calibration](https://bossgarage.eu/en/products/timing-light-gun).

Export the VE table (for later importing).

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image1.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image61.png)

Zero the entire table or disconnect the injectors so that it doesn't inject fuel while cranking.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image50.png)

Lock the timing.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image58.png)

On the crank, there are 4 marks: 18, 16, 14 and 0 degrees.

The lone mark is 0 degrees. Mark it with a white highlighter.

Put the timing light clamp on spark plug wire number 1 (with the arrow pointing towards the spark plug).

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image39.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image54.png)

Crank the engine and check if you can see the 0-degree mark.

If not, adjust the trigger angle settings by 30Âº at a time until you see it.

Then make fine adjustments until the crank mark aligns with the distribution cover mark.

After synchronizing the base timing, import the VE table or reconnect the injectors.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image33.png)

Now, unlock the timing and add 5 to 10 degrees for cranking.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image53.png)

Now, start your car ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Idle Control

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image42.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image26.png)

Choose your wideband from the list.

If it's not listed, choose "Custom Linear WB" and set the wideband controller values.

### Launch Control

Some cars have clutch switches, but most need to be wired to a switch that sends ground to pin **OBD1 B7** when the clutch is pressed.

### Boost Control

Connect the negative wire of the [MAC Electronic Boost Controller Valve](https://bossgarage.eu/en/products/mac-electronic-boost-pressure-valve) to pin **OBD1 B11**.

### CEL / Shift Light / Temp Light

You can use the engine light as a shift light or as desired through a programmable output.

### Tachometer

The tachometer is controlled by the distributor. When converting to a coil-on-plug system, you need to activate the **TACH** jumper on the PCB.

If you want to use the TACH output with the distributor, that's possible!

Just remove the distributor wire **IGR** and activate the **TACH** jumper.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image48.png)

This way, you can have the tacho sweep on boot while maintaining the stock distributor.

Activate tacho output and tacho sweep effect on boot:
