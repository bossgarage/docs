The Honduino OBD2 DPFI is an aftermarket engine control unit (ECU) designed specifically for Honda vehicles with DPFI (Dual Point Fuel Injection) systems. This guide walks you through the complete setup, calibration, and advanced configuration of the V4 version of this ECU.

This documentation covers:

- Initial setup and installation of required software
- Configuring fundamental ECU parameters (trigger wheel, ignition, injection)
- Connecting and calibrating the ECU with your vehicle
- Setting up advanced features like wideband O2 sensing, launch control, and boost control
- Reference pinout diagrams for connecting inputs and outputs

Whether you're upgrading from the stock ECU or replacing an existing aftermarket unit, this guide provides step-by-step instructions to get your Honda running with optimal performance using the Honduino OBD2 DPFI V4.

## Before Connecting the ECU to the Car

### Download and Install

- **TunerStudio software:** [Download TunerStudio Software](https://www.tunerstudio.com/index.php/downloads)
- **USB driver:** [Download USB Driver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M8Ii3CX8lBSuSgio2_ZTu5E-1pwgyTAY/view?usp=sharing)

**Connectivity:**

- **Bluetooth:** Connect via USB to power the ECU and pair the Bluetooth
- **USB:** *Unplug the Bluetooth module* and connect via the USB

### Create a Project and Detect Firmware

### Ignition

On the board Jumper JP1, select the voltage sent to the coils:

- Honda distributor coil: 12V
- VAG / K20 coils: 5V

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image44.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image14.png)

**Spark Output Mode:**

- Single channel: Distributor
- Sequential: Coil-on-plug

If you want to convert to a coil-on-plug system, you need to change the distributor disc to: **[Distributor Disc for Honda DPFI](https://bossgarage.eu/en/products/distributor-disc-honda-dpfi)**.

And configure the trigger wheel pattern to be the same as your disc pattern.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image37.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image34.png)

And connect each coil signal to the respective pin declared in the ECU pinout topic.

### Injection

**WARNING:** Use only high impedance injectors (> 8 ohm) or low impedance with resistor box.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image40.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image46.png)

Change the engine displacement and injector flow rate.

## Connecting and Calibrating the ECU

### Calibrate TPS

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image52.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image60.png)

Click on the closed throttle "Get current" button.

Then press full throttle and click on the full throttle "Get current" button.

Now, click "Accept" to save.

### Calibrate MAP

STOCK = Sensor in the engine bay

MPX = Map sensor on the board

Stock map sensor configurations:

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image24.png) ![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image32.png)

### Electric Fan

You can control the electric fan by connecting the **OBD1 A8** terminal from the ECU to the negative terminal of the fan relay coil.

### Base Timing

To sync the ignition timing with the engine, it's necessary to adjust with the help of a [Timing Light Gun for Ignition Calibration](https://bossgarage.eu/en/products/timing-light-gun).

Export the VE table (for later importing).

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image1.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image61.png)

Zero the entire table or disconnect the injectors so that it doesn't inject fuel while cranking.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image50.png)

Lock the timing.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image58.png)

On the crank, there are 4 marks: 18, 16, 14 and 0 degrees.

The lone mark is 0 degrees. Mark it with a white highlighter.

Put the timing light clamp on spark plug wire number 1 (with the arrow pointing towards the spark plug).

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image36.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image39.png)

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image54.png)

Crank the engine and check if you can see the 0-degree mark.

If not, adjust the trigger angle settings by 30º at a time until you see it.

Then make fine adjustments until the crank mark aligns with the distribution cover mark.

After synchronizing the base timing, import the VE table or reconnect the injectors.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image33.png)

Now, unlock the timing and add 5 to 10 degrees for cranking.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image53.png)

Now, start your car 🎉🎉🎉

### Idle Control

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image26.png)

Choose your wideband from the list.

If it's not listed, choose "Custom Linear WB" and set the wideband controller values.

### Launch Control

Some cars have clutch switches, but most need to be wired to a switch that sends ground to pin **OBD1 B7** when the clutch is pressed.

### CEL / Shift Light / Temp Light

You can use the engine light as a shift light or as desired through a programmable output.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image10.png)

### Tachometer

The tachometer is controlled by the distributor. When converting to a coil-on-plug system, you need to activate the **TACH** jumper on the PCB.

If you want to use the TACH output with the distributor, that's possible!

Just remove the distributor wire **IGR** and activate the **TACH** jumper.

![Image](/images/honda/obd2-dpfi/v4/image48.png)

This way, you can have the tacho sweep on boot while maintaining the stock distributor.

Activate tacho output and tacho sweep effect on boot:
